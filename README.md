# DiceGame: [lien](https://lana-12.github.io/eval-JS-DiceGame/) 

## Rules:
  The game features 2 players on a single screen. 
    Each player has a temporary score (CURRENT) and a global score (global).
    At each turn, the player's CURRENT is initialized to 0, and he can roll a die as many times as he likes. The result of a roll is added to the global score. 
  At any time during his turn, the player may decide to:
      - Click on the "Hold" option, which sends the CURRENT's points to the GLOBAL. It will then be the
          the other player's turn.
      - Roll the die. If he rolls a 1, his CURRENT score is lost and his turn is over.

  The first player to reach 100 points on global wins the game.
